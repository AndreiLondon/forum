FORUM

Objectives
This project consists in creating a web forum that allows :

- communication between users.
- associating categories to posts.
- liking and disliking posts and comments.
- filtering posts.

SQLite
In order to store the data in your forum (like users, posts, comments, etc.) you will use the database library SQLite.

SQLite is a popular choice as an embedded database software for local/client storage in application software such as web browsers. It enables you to create a database as well as controlling it by using queries.

To structure your database and to achieve better performance we highly advise you to take a look at the entity relationship diagram and build one based on your own database.

You must use at least one SELECT, one CREATE and one INSERT queries.
