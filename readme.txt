SQLite
In order to store the data in your forum (like users, posts, comments, etc.) 
you will use the database library SQLite.

- You must use at least one SELECT, one CREATE and one INSERT queries.
To know more about SQLite you can check the SQLite page.

Authentication

In this segment the client must be able to register as a new user on the forum, by inputting their credentials. You also have to create a login session to access the forum and be able to add posts and comments.

You should use cookies to allow each user to have only one opened session. Each of this sessions must contain an expiration date. It is up to you to decide how long the cookie stays "alive". The use of UUID is a Bonus task.
