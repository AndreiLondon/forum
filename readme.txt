Objectives
This project consists in creating a web forum that allows :

SQLite
In order to store the data in your forum (like users, posts, comments, etc.) you will use the database library SQLite.
SQLite is a popular choice as an embedded database software for local/client storage in application software
such as web browsers. It enables you to create a database as well as controlling it by using queries.
